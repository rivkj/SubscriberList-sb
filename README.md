# SubscriberList-sb
In the lab, we'll build a simple API to test the concepts from the lesson. The API will be used to interact with users of a sample application.
- create a new Spring Boot app, adding on the addition of Thyme Templates.
- create a project that allows users to Subscribe to an online site.
- build out a form that will allow users to sign-up and display their entry on a separate page.
- create more views for performing CRUD actions with our Subscribers database.
